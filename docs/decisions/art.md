- Slice 1, the lineup page: `?lineup` (all), `?lineup=heroes`, `?lineup=goblins` on any build opens a page
  over the game that draws every unit in every move (stand, walk, wind up, strike, recover, hurt, flinch,
  stagger, die) with the game's own drawHero and drawFoe, on grey flagstones, through the real lighting
  pass (torches, stepped bands, dither). Two CSS pixels a scene pixel, the scale a phone sees the game at.
  Each move is set from the room's own fields (the act and its clock; a goblin's wind-up is its attack's
  `t` against `windup`), looped so it plays. A draw that throws shows a red cross. Files:
  `src/client/lineup.ts` (the page), `lineupcast.ts` (who and how), a three-line hook in main.ts,
  `scripts/lineup-look.cjs` (one phone screenshot of it). (Claude Opus 5.5)
