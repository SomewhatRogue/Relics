## 2026-11-01: heights and forks (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: multiple heights and paths within missions that make heroes choose how to move together or
attack threats.

- **Two levels to start: the ground and up on a ledge** (`Ledge` in `shared/arena.ts`). A ledge is a
  rock shelf (mines, forests) or a timber wall walk (villages, farms) along the back of a room. From
  the ground its edge is a wall; from on top you can step off it (a drop: you land, no harm). A ramp
  overlaps its edge: inside the ramp you take the level of where you stand, so stairs are just a place
  the wall isn't. All of it is in `collide`, so heroes, goblins and the tests share one rule. Bodies
  carry `z` (0 or 1); a prop has none and stays on the ground.
- **What height changes:** a blade only reaches your own level (up top you're out of reach of the
  ground, and they of you); grabs too. Arrows, bolts, spells, javelins, hooks and nets reach up and
  down. Shots from up on a ledge hit 1.25x (`HEIGHT.shot`). A goblin knocked off a ledge fast (thrown,
  hooked, blasted) takes the fall: 12 damage and a stun; one that steps off just lands.
- **Archers** (`ARCHER`): a scrapper with a bow. It keeps its distance on the ground and holds its
  perch up high, draws on you for a full second with a thin sightline telegraph, and looses: block it,
  parry it (the archer is stunned where it stands), or roll. Goblins with blades go round by the ramp
  to reach you up high; archers don't come down.
- **Forks:** the middle room of a three-room job has two ways out instead of one: THE HIGH ROAD (the
  next room has a ledge with three archers on it and two fewer goblins below) or THE LOW ROAD (one
  more goblin below and someone caged to free, even in the last room). The run remembers the road
  (`Run.roads`), so the same job can play two ways.
- **The way on takes the whole party.** Every exit, and each road at a fork, opens only when every
  player in the room stands in it (`Game.together`); solo that's you. Online this is how the party
  chooses a road together: walk into it as a group. Splitting at a fork (the leader running both
  rooms) is possible with the multi-room host, and saved for later.
- Not yet: more than two levels, ledges out in the middle of a room (they draw against the back wall
  for now), rooftops you climb by ladder, a lever up top that opens a gate below. Recorded in the atlas.

## 2026-11-01: heroes for life, every building enterable, buildings that burn, Come Bye's online lessons (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: pick your class at the start when you first load in, with its own level, and no changing it in
a game; every building enterable with things inside and people to talk to for upgrades; mission
buildings that can be burned out and destroyed, visibly, or entered. Then: this will be online and
offline; Come Bye's team wrote up joining and moving between servers; build towards it early without
paying much.

- **The start screen** (`client/title.ts`): your heroes, up to three, each with a name, a class for
  life, its own level, gold, perks, kit and fitted elements; play one, make one, retire one (asks
  twice). The world (town, chapter, votes) is shared by all of them. Saves are v2 (`relic.save.v2`:
  heroes, current, world); a v1 save's hero comes across as HERO, its class from its weapon.
- **No class, kit or element changes in play.** The CLASS, WEAPON and AUGMENT buttons and the C, Q, T
  keys are gone, and `Game.step` holds those press counters still in every mode. Kits change at the
  smith (within the class); the relic-wright fits fire, frost or storm to a relic for 45 gold (free to
  take out), kept on the hero. HEROES in the corner opens the start screen (not mid-job).
  `?hero=MAGE` skips the start screen for the scripts.
- **Every Wickhold building has a door and people** (`shared/interiors.ts`, `client/npcs.ts`). Walk up
  into the door (or ENTER on a phone); walk out the bottom to stand back at the door. The forge
  (Halvard the smith, Ivo the relic-wright), the church (Father Odric, Marta), the training hall
  (Master Cole, and Squire Pell who takes you to the yard), the infirmary (Sister Agne and up to three
  patients), a new town hall where the council table was (Reeve Hollis and two councillors), the
  granary (Farmer Jos) and every lit house on Rescue Row (a family of two, with rumours that hint at
  places and tactics). Old Wenna and Tam stand in the square; Dessa the trader at the market once the
  traders are in. A gold mark over anyone you can talk to, their name when you're close.
- **Buildings on a job** (`sim/buildings.ts`, tuning `BLAZE` and `WOOD` in `shared/props.ts`).
  Cottages and barns, fences and goblin dens are wood with health. Blows chip them (half damage),
  blasts knock at them; oil fire, fire blasts and burning goblins set them alight; fire burns them
  down in about six seconds, spreads to wood within a tile after 2.5 s, and catches goblins standing
  close. Burned down, a building is ash and stubs you walk over (it stops colliding). Drawn charred
  under half health, with flames, smoke and window glow while burning, embers after; a fire lights
  the street. Town buildings have no health and never burn.
- **Cottages and barns can be entered** on a job: turned over inside, one to four goblins, a cage
  with someone in it on rescue jobs (a third of cottages and half of barns otherwise), a butcher in
  some barns where it's bad. The inside stays as you left it for that room; a burning or burned
  building can't be entered.
- **A new job: Burn out the dens.** The last room holds three dens, each with an oil barrel by it;
  a standing den sends out a scrapper every 9 s (up to six goblins about). The room is done when the
  dens are ash.
- **Online, from Come Bye's write-up** (`docs/ONLINE.md` here, the full one in Comearound): copied
  their newer relay and its tests (publish through Redis only while another instance has players:
  about 100 hours of play a month on the free plan instead of 3; dead hosts can't hold a room; a
  Redis hiccup can't kill an instance). What it changes for us now: the room is plain data the leader
  can save every 2 s; the room outside a building keeps running while you're in (the leader will run
  every room someone is in, so a party can split); seats come back by hero name; the shared world is
  written per run, never per tick.

## 2026-11-01: the town and the loop, terrain, the story mission and the council (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: get to work on the town and the gameplay loops; other terrain types and how maps and
scenarios are made; bigger story missions and decisions the group votes on that change the world
and the town.

- **The game starts in Wickhold** (`shared/town.ts`), built from the shared world's state: Lantern
  Square (the Last Lantern, the job board, the council table), the Church, the Forge, the Training
  Yard, Market Row, the Infirmary, Rescue Row (a lit house per two people brought home), the north
  gate. Walk up to a spot and USE it (E or F on a laptop; a USE button on a phone, where the combat
  buttons hide in town). The training room is now the Training Yard; walk out the bottom to leave.
- **Maps are data** (`shared/arena.ts`): size, blocks (buildings, rock walls, fences: footprints you
  walk behind), round things (pillars, trees, pines, rocks, hay, wells, supports, the Lantern),
  braziers, torches, the way out, and a theme (floor, back wall, ambient light, moonlight). One map
  is in use at a time (the room sets it), so collision never needs it passed around.
- **Run rooms are laid out from the job's seed** (`shared/terrain.ts`): village (cottages, a well),
  farm (barn, fences, hay), fields (standing wheat, hay), forest (trees, pines), mine (rock walls,
  pit props, oil, dark: heroes carry a lantern). Objective first, then buildings, round things,
  furniture, a goblin campfire, goblins in the top half; spawn, exit and the middle lane stay clear.
  Ruin and the room's place set the goblin count; a butcher joins at ruin 2.
- **Jobs** (`shared/jobs.ts`): three a day from seven places across four regions. Objectives:
  rescue (break the cages), hunt (a named butcher), larder (smash the racks). Twist: night. Three
  rooms; clear each to open the way out at the top; the last holds the job. Run goblins stay dead.
  Three downs and you're driven back with half the gold and nobody saved.
- **Progress** (`shared/progress.ts`, saved in this browser for now): gold and experience from kills
  (scrapper 4 and 10, butcher 30 and 60, a named one 80 and 150), 25 experience per person freed, 50
  and the job's pay for finishing. Levels at 100, 300, 600... (cap 10 in chapter 1); each level is a
  pick of one of two perks at the trainer (tough, endurance, relic sworn, footwork, guard, second
  wind). The smith sells a fine weapon (60), the trader a forged one (160, once the market opens).
  Gold given at the church feeds the Lantern (the Want comes later).
- **Chapter 1** (`shared/story.ts`): bring 6 people home and finish the story mission, Barrowby's
  Bell (four rooms at night, the Gnawer in the church, three cages). Then the council table opens:
  farm the north fields (jobs pay 25% more, a granary goes up) or take in the refugees (four more on
  Rescue Row, the trader opens). A council needs 4; in this solo demo you can decide alone. The vote
  is recorded with its voters and day; chapter 2 is written at the review.

## 2026-10-31 (late): props to smash, lift and throw (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: pick up and throw barrels and tables (and broken pieces) if you're a big enough character,
like the knight or a barbarian; the rogue and ranger can't.

- **Props are bodies** (`shared/props.ts`, `sim/props.ts`): barrels (2.5), an oil barrel, crates (3)
  and a table (4) stand in the training room. Blows, shots, blasts, wall slams and flying goblins
  push and break them; they break into staves and planks (lighter pieces that fade after 25 s).
  Big ones come back after 20 s in the training room. Shots stop on them.
- **Only strong classes lift** (`STRONG`: the Warrior now; a Barbarian when the Warrior forks into
  Knight or Barbarian). GRAB takes a goblin first if one is earned, else the nearest prop. Overhead
  you walk at 70% (56% for a crate or table); ATTACK slams it down (28 to goblins within 1.3 tiles,
  it breaks); GRAB throws it at 14 tiles a second. A thrown prop hits like its weight (0.8 per tile
  a second times weight, up to 45) and breaks on any goblin it hits at speed.
- **The oil barrel** bursts into flame when broken: everything within 1.8 tiles burns.
- **Goblin grabs stay for every class** (they're earned by skill, not strength); lifting furniture is
  the strong classes' extra.

## 2026-10-31 (after midnight): grab, slam, throw, and deaths by the blow (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: more dynamic hits and deaths: slam a goblin into the ground and pound its head off so it
bursts, or chop it off; pick a unit up and throw it at another.

- **Grab is earned** (`sim/grab.ts`): only a small goblin (weight 1 or less) you've stunned, netted,
  frozen, staggered or got behind, within 1.3 tiles. G on a laptop; on a phone a GRAB button shows up
  only when there's something to grab. Overhead you walk at 60%; ATTACK (now SLAM) drives it into the
  ground (30, crater, stunned 1.5 s, a kill pounds its head in); GRAB again (THROW) hurls it 16 tiles a
  second, airborne 0.35 s. It wriggles free after 3 s; being hit or rolling drops it.
- **Bodies hit bodies** (`sim/impacts.ts`): anything driving into another goblin at 6 tiles a second
  or more hurts both (1.5 per tile a second, up to 25) and passes momentum on by weight. Thrown,
  blasted, smitten or greatsworded goblins bowl their friends over; the butcher barely moves. Frozen
  ones shatter. Only a body actually closing on the other counts, so a pair never re-hits.
- **Deaths by the killing blow** (`kill(e, ev, how)`): blades take the head (it flies, eyes still
  lit, a fountain from the neck); maces, slams, blasts, smites, wall splats, body hits and any kill
  20 or more past the life left burst the body into pieces; fire leaves a charred body; ice
  shatters; thrusts and arrows drop them. Pieces fly with height and land as stains that stay.
- Headless and charred bodies stay until the respawn; burst and shattered ones leave only the floor.

## 2026-10-31 (midnight): loot that rewards execution (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: weapons with modifiers so each fight drops loot and unlocks things as you progress, without
drowning in stats and meta-gaming; and more skill-based execution throughout.

- **A weapon is its kit plus at most two traits, in words.** Fine: one skill trait. Forged: a skill
  trait plus an element (named for it: EMBERFORGED GREATSWORD). One weapon per kit, so no inventory:
  stand on a drop, read the card, TAKE (F) swaps it in and leaves your old one on the floor.
- **Every trait pays off only on execution** (`shared/loot.ts`): RIPOSTE (counters x1.4 on top),
  TEMPO (dodge through a blow: next hit x2), BULWARK (a parry refills stamina), DEADEYE (a perfect
  release x1.6), CRUSHING (goblins you throw into walls take x3 slam), BRUTAL (held-fast goblins take
  x1.5 more), REAPER (a backstab or counter kill heals 10). Forged elements land only on charged
  hits (70%+), counters, full draws and crossbow bolts, never on taps.
- **Draws have a sweet spot for everyone:** release within 0.25 s of the white flash for a perfect
  shot; hold more than 0.8 s past it and the bow shakes and the shot drops to 75% (no pierce).
- **Drops:** scrappers 35% (20% forged), the butcher always (60% forged), rolled for the nearest
  player's class on a separate seeded stream (`lootRng`), fading after 45 s.
- **Progression stays sideways:** loot changes how a weapon plays, not a number that climbs. Vertical
  power comes from town (new kits, relics and augments unlocked at the smith and relic-wright; levels
  that open ability choices). No gear score.

## 2026-10-31 (late night): class kits by draw time, slower classes, class relics (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle after trying slice 2d: no three-shot pattern on the bow; the long pullback is great; different
bows with different draw times and damage; Mage spells the same way (a quick one, a long charge one);
every class too mobile, only the Rogue should be; keep the mage's teleport but trade it off; no blast
flask; the horn only as an ally buff for Warrior and Healer; Healer smites big, keeps the third-hit
heal, targets allies to heal and buff; different relics per class.

- **Ranged and spells are one shot per press** (`combo` of one) and a hold draws or casts; each kit
  has its own `draw` time. Longbow 1.4 s to 55 that pierces the line (only at a full draw);
  shortbow 0.55 s to 22, walk at 70% while drawing; crossbow fires on the press (`noCharge`), 34 that
  hurls light goblins, 1.15 s reload. Wand 0.6 s, staff 1.6 s to a 65 orb that bursts 2.2 wide, rod
  1 s to a piercing lance. Spells take the equipped relic's element; arrows and bolts don't.
- **Mobility:** only the Rogue walks faster than base (1.15); everyone else 0.78 to 0.92, with shorter
  rolls (1.9 to 2.4 tiles) and longer recharges (0.65 to 1 s). The blink keeps its 3.4 tiles but costs
  40 stamina and recharges in 1.6 s.
- **Healer:** third mace blow heals everyone within 3 tiles for 8; the hold (1.2 s) calls a holy smite
  onto the goblin faced (up to 6 tiles; where you point on a laptop): 70, stuns 1.2 s.
- **Relics by class** (`CLASS_RELICS`; racks and the L key are gone): Warrior javelin, hook, war
  horn. Ranger hunter's net (snares small goblins flat, slows big ones), hook. Rogue shadowstep
  (behind the goblin you face), hook. Mage lodestone (lobbed; drags goblins inward 1.8 s, then
  bursts). Healer blessing (heals 20, then 1.3x damage dealt and 0.75x taken for 8 s; most hurt ally
  on a phone, nearest to where you point on a laptop), war horn. Horn: allies within 6 refill
  stamina, regenerate it twice as fast and block at half cost for 6 s.
- **A squire** stands by the swing dummy taking hits, so the Healer has someone to heal and bless.
- Gale horn (as a knockback) and blast flask removed.

## 2026-10-31 (night, last): classes, magic augments, new relics, the world atlas (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: weapon types for the other classes, more relic types and magic augments, a class button for the
demo, and start mapping the town, quests, scenarios and locations (fields, farms, towns, cities,
mines, forests; some places more wrecked than others).

- **Classes for the demo:** C or CLASS cycles Warrior (sword and shield, greatsword), Ranger (longbow,
  spear), Rogue (twin daggers), Mage (focus staff), Healer (mace and censer). Q or WEAPON swaps within
  the class (`CLASS_KITS`). Each class has its own sprite colours and hood.
- **Longbow:** taps loose arrows (stop in the first body, stick in walls); a held draw pierces every
  goblin in a line and knocks them into walls. **Focus staff:** sparks, a burst on the third, a held
  orb that bursts and throws; it casts with the equipped relic's augment (the focus relic from the
  kickoff); its dodge is a blink. **Mace and censer:** every third blow heals heroes within 3 tiles
  for 6, the held blessing hits all round and heals 10 to 30. Shots live in `sim/bolts.ts`.
- **New relics:** the gale horn (a cone that throws goblins by weight) and the blast flask (lobbed to
  where you point, or the goblin you face on a phone; bursts and throws everyone outward). A hero
  carries a rack of three (`LOADOUTS`); L or RELICS takes the next rack until the town's armoury exists.
- **Magic augments** (T or AUGMENT, on the equipped relic; `sim/elements.ts`): fire burns 4 every
  0.5 s for 3 s and spreads by touch; frost chills (half speed and turn), a second frost freezes
  solid for 2.2 s; storm arcs to the 2 nearest goblins within 3.2 tiles and to any goblin with a
  javelin stuck in it within 6 (lightning rods). Together: fire and frost make steam (cancels both,
  10 damage, stuns everything near); storm, a heavy blow, a heavy shot or a wall slam shatters the
  frozen (30); storm on the burning flares (12 and a throw). Bows shoot plain arrows for now.
- **World atlas** (Docs artifact, link in PLAN): Wickhold as the proposed town name, its districts and
  gates, five regions, ruin levels 0 to 4, eleven kinds of place, twelve objectives, ten twists.
  Proposals for Kyle to cut or change.

## 2026-10-31 (night, latest): the relic wheel (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: switching relics on a phone was too slow; hold the relic button and quick-select, with only a
few relics equippable.

- Heroes carry a relic **loadout** of at most 3 (`RELIC_SLOTS`; chosen in town later). Tap RELIC to
  use the equipped one; **hold** it (0.26 s) and the carried relics fan out up and to the left of the
  thumb with their recharge shown; slide onto one and let go to equip it, let go elsewhere to cancel.
  The button shows the equipped relic's name. The fight doesn't pause (it's shared online).
- Laptop: 1, 2, 3 pick a slot directly; R still cycles; E uses. The top RELIC chip is gone.

## 2026-10-31 (night, later): kits guard and dodge differently (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: sword and shield should block easiest and best; greatsword and spear need more timing; classes
should differ in speed, dodge recharge, dodge range and direction. Until classes exist, each weapon
kit carries these (`Weapon` in tuning) and they move to the class later.

| Kit | Parry window | Guard arc | Block cost | Speed | Dodge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sword and shield | 0.36 s | 170 deg | 1x | 1.0 | roll 3 tiles, 0.5 s recharge |
| Greatsword | 0.20 s | 110 deg | 1.5x | 0.85 | heavy roll 2.3 tiles, 0.8 s |
| Spear | 0.24 s | 120 deg | 1.3x | 0.95 | backstep 2.4 tiles away from facing, keeps facing, 0.45 s |
| Twin daggers | 0.20 s | 100 deg | 1.8x | 1.15 | dash 3.6 tiles, 0.3 s |

- The telegraph's white parry cue uses the player's own kit window, so it always tells the truth.
- Class mapping to carry over later: Warrior (sword and shield or greatsword), Ranger (spear-like
  backstep, then Rogue's dash), Mage (a blink), Healer (to decide).

## 2026-10-31 (night): corpses ride the javelin, backstabs (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle: the javelin should carry the body back even when the throw kills; some classes (a rogue,
maybe a Ranger upgrade) should do more from behind, so they want to roll behind an enemy and attack.

- **Corpses ride the javelin:** a light enemy killed by the throw (or by the pin) is carried to the
  wall and hangs there (`Enemy.corpse`), fading just before it respawns.
- **Backstabs:** any blow from behind does 1.25x (`GUARD.rearMult`); behind means standing where the
  target's facing points away (dot below -0.35). No extra knockback (Kyle's Old Gods flanking rule).
- **Twin daggers** (the rogue's kit, fourth weapon on Q for now): fast 4-hit combo, weak block, 2.5x
  from behind. With daggers in hand each goblin's back shows as a purple arc, bright when you're in it.
- **Enemies turn at their own pace** (butcher 2.4 rad/s, scrapper 7) and only attack once they face
  you, so rolling past the butcher (rolls pass through) leaves his back open for a moment.
- **Design:** Ranger's subclass fork becomes Sharpshooter or Rogue (backstabs), per Kyle.

## 2026-10-31 (late): parry that lands, weapons, heavies, knockback, relics (Claude Opus 5.5)

Kyle after his first play: parrying was hard to pull off and should stun; wants animation with the
telegraphs; collision with enemies and knockback by type; combos per weapon and hold for a heavy; a
rechargeable javelin relic that pins small enemies to walls; grappling hooks; physics impacts on the
world; elemental modifiers later, all as relics.

- **Parry:** window 0.18 s to 0.30 s before the hit; the telegraph turns white for exactly that
  window (the cue is the judged window); a parry **stuns** (butcher 2.2 s, scrapper 1.8 s) with
  "STUNNED", stars and a slump; stunned or pinned enemies take 1.5x; counter window 1.1 to 1.6 s.
- **Weapons** (`WEAPONS` in tuning, Q or the WEAPON chip): sword and shield (3 slashes, best block),
  greatsword (2 wide slow sweeps, big knockback, weak block), spear (4 quick thrusts, long reach).
- **Hold to charge:** a tap swings on release; holding past 0.18 s charges (slower walk, gold glow,
  white ring at full charge at 0.9 s); release for the weapon's heavy, damage and knockback scaling
  with charge. A strong heavy (70%+) flinches the butcher out of his wind-up.
- **Bodies and knockback** (`sim/bodies.ts`): nobody walks through anybody (lighter one gives way;
  rolls pass through); every blow pushes by its knock divided by weight (scrapper 0.6, hero 1,
  butcher 3.5, dummies immovable); a fast slide into a wall or pillar is a wall slam for 6 and a crack.
- **Goblin scrappers** (two): small, quick stab with a short telegraph, flinch on any hit.
- **Animation with every telegraph:** the butcher hauls the cleaver back, trembles, chops with a smear;
  for the slam he leaps, hangs, comes down squashed with a crater, debris and a shockwave. Scrappers pull
  the knife back and lunge. Swing dummy winds its club up.
- **Relics** (E or RELIC, R or the RELIC chip to swap; each recharges): the **relic javelin** carries
  anything weight 1 or lighter to the first wall or pillar and **pins** it there (2.6 s, +12), sticks
  into heavier bodies, stays in the world 9 s; the **grappling hook** yanks light enemies to you
  (arriving stunned) or pulls you to walls, pillars and heavy enemies. Phones auto-aim relics at the
  nearest goblin in the relic's range.
- **Marks on the world:** slam craters, wall cracks and blood stay on the floor and walls.
- **Next for relics (Kyle):** elemental modifiers that play off one another; keep relics data-driven.

## 2026-10-31: slices 1 and 2, the training room (Claude Opus 5.5)

- **Kyle's calls carried in from the kickoff doc:** Relic; three-quarter view; click or tap to
  attack; one button to block (hold) or parry (tap on time); parries open a counter; dodge roll;
  big enemies telegraph on the floor, some unblockable; the lit pixel look from the style mock.
- **No Phaser for now.** The approved look is per-pixel stepped lighting with dither. A small custom
  renderer does it directly: paint the scene flat at low resolution with Canvas 2D, then one WebGL2
  pass lights it and lays the glowing layer on top. About 40 KB of script, nothing to fight. Phaser
  (or Tiled tooling) can come back when maps need it.
- **Timings (first pass, `src/shared/tuning.ts`):** parry window 0.18 s before the hit (re-presses
  within 0.35 s don't reopen it), counter window 1.1 s at 2.5x, roll 3 tiles in 0.32 s untouchable
  from 0.04 to 0.26 s, block chip 15% at 1.4 stamina per point, butcher cleave wind-up 1.0 s, slam
  1.3 s (unblockable, striped edge, "!" over his head). Each hero has a `lenience` for online ping.
- **Phones aim for you:** with no mouse, an attack or a block turns the hero to the nearest enemy
  in reach, so a parry faces the right way.
- **Relay copied from Come Bye** with its keys renamed (`rl:`); its 16 tests pass here. Not wired to
  the client until slice 3.
