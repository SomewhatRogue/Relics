/**
 * The room relay, as Vercel's docs lay out for realtime on Functions: each player holds a WebSocket
 * to a Vercel Function; any instance may hold any player, so instances share rooms through Redis
 * (one pub/sub channel per room for messages, keys for who hosts). Each instance delivers to its
 * own sockets first and publishes with its origin id, skipping its own echoes.
 *
 * The game itself runs in the host's browser (the GameRoom); the relay only routes messages:
 * friends' input to the host, the host's snapshots and events to friends.
 *
 * Player URL: /api/room?room=CODE&id=PLAYER&want=host|take|join
 *   host: made this room (or hosted it on this device); take: was playing in it and its host left;
 *   join: opened someone's code. Only host/take may claim the room; join waits for a host.
 * To the player: {t:'role', role:'host'} | {t:'role', role:'guest', host} | {t:'nohost'} |
 *   {t:'hosted', id} | {t:'left', id} | {t:'msg', from, d} | {t:'info', shared}
 * From the player: {to: '*' | id, d}
